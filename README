## About ##

This code is originally written (and maintained) over at http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding.

I'm forking it here for easier access, and to maintain my changes to the tabTrigger.

The original zen-css tab triggers required typing colons between keys and values. I found this requirement unnecessary and annoying.

This revised bundle removes the requirement, so instead of typing 'ov:a' you can simply type 'ova' and it will output overflow:auto;

## Installation ##

In the terminal:

$ cd ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/
$ git clone git://github.com/panpainter/Zen-CSS.git Zen-CSS.tmbundle
